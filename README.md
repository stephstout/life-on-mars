## Major Hurdles
- My biggest challenge was writing the block of code that made the rover camera links work. Initially I would have to click a camera, then click home to reset it. By putting params in state, I was able to load the correct info and maintain a SPA.
- Smaller hurdles included accessing specific API data, styling with CSS, and using React Router.
